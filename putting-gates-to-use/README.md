# Putting gates to use

In the last section, we saw that quantum gates can be combined to do anything: they can acheive universality. Soon you'll also see specific examples of quantum gates in action, as part of quantum algorithms designed to tackle specific problems.

First we'll look at small scale uses of quantum gates. This will involve doing things like using gates to transform the effects of others in useful ways, and building three qubit gates like the Toffoli from single and two qubit operations.

We'll also take a deeper look at a concept introduced in the first section: that quantum variables are fundamentally different from classical ones. There are multiple processes we can set up to prove this, and in this chapter we look at two of the most prominent.
