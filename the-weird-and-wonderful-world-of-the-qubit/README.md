# The weird and wonderful world of the qubit

At the heart of quantum computing is the qubit. This name is pronounced 'cue-bit' and is short for 'quantum bit'. It is the basic unit of quantum information: the quantum version of a bit. Everything in quantum computing revolves around it.

In this section we'll start diving deeper into the world of qubits. For this, we'll need some way of keeping track of what they are doing when we apply gates. The mathematical language of vectors and matrices is tool for this job.

This chapter will be most effective for readers who are already familiar with vectors and matrices. Those who aren't familiar should hopefully be fine too, though they may need the help of a search engine now and then.
