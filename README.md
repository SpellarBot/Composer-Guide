# Welcome to quantum

If you think quantum physics sounds challenging, you are not alone. All of our intuitions are based on day-to-day experiences and are defined by the laws of classical physics—so the concepts in quantum physics can be counterintuitive at first. In order to comprehend the quantum world, you must allow yourself to develop an intuition for a completely different, and often surprising, set of laws.

At IBM, our goal is to introduce you to the quantum world through our tutorials, and provide the hands-on opportunity to experiment with using a real quantum computing processor. We hope to foster a quantum intuition in the greater community, and spark further interest in those who are curious. By making quantum concepts more widely understood—even on a general level—we can more deeply explore all the possibilities quantum computing offers, and more rapidly bring its exciting power to a world whose perspective is limited by classical physics.

In this guide we'll introduce quantum concepts through quantum programming. Specifically, we'll focus on the basic unit of quantum computation: the _circuit_. This simplest way to create and run these is using our tool known as the composer. This allows you to create circuits in a visual way, by dragging and dropping quantum operations. You can also write them directly using the OpenQASM quantum assembly language. To get started, just click on the link at the bottom of the page.

If you'd rather learn about Qiskit, which provides powerful tools for creating, manipulating and combining circuits, see the guide [here](https://learnqiskit.gitbook.io).
