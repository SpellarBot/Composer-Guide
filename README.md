# Welcome to quantum

If you think quantum physics sounds challenging, you are not alone. All of our intuitions are based on day-to-day experiences and are defined by the laws of classical physics—so the concepts in quantum physics can be counterintuitive at first. In order to comprehend the quantum world, you must allow yourself to develop an intuition for a completely different, and often surprising, set of laws.

At IBM, our goal is to introduce you to the quantum world through our tutorials, and provide the hands-on opportunity to experiment with using a real quantum computing processor. We hope to foster a quantum intuition in the greater community, and spark further interest in those who are curious. By making quantum concepts more widely understood—even on a general level—we can more deeply explore all the possibilities quantum computing offers, and more rapidly bring its exciting power to a world whose perspective is limited by classical physics.

The basic unit of quantum computation is the _circuit_. We provide multiple ways to create these circuits, with the simplest being part of our _composer_ tool. This is the tutorial for the composer To get started, just click on the link at the bottom of the page.
