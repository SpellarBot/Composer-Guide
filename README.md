# Welcome to quantum

If you think quantum physics sounds challenging, you are not alone. All of our intuitions are based on day-to-day experiences and are defined by the laws of classical physics—so the concepts in quantum physics can be counterintuitive at first. In order to comprehend the quantum world, you must allow yourself to develop an intuition for a completely different, and often surprising, set of laws.

At IBM, our goal is to introduce you to the quantum world through our tutorials, and provide the hands-on opportunity to experiment with using a real quantum computing processor. We hope to foster a quantum intuition in the greater community, and spark further interest in those who are curious. By making quantum concepts more widely understood—even on a general level—we can more deeply explore all the possibilities quantum computing offers, and more rapidly bring its exciting power to a world whose perspective is limited by classical physics.

In this guide we'll introduce quantum concepts through quantum programming. Specifically, we'll focus on the basic unit of quantum computation: the _circuit_. 

To create and run circuits you can use our Composer tool, as well as our Qiskit programming framework. In either case the circuits you create can be written using a simple language known as OpenQASM. In this guide we will mostly express circuits and code snippets in this language, which you can then copy and past to use in the Composer or Qiskit.
