# Universality of quantum computation

It's important to know what quantum computers can do, and what they can't. Also, if we have a specific set of quantum operations we can use, it's important to know whether they are limited to a small corner of quantum computation, or whether they can do everything. To deal with these issues, we need the concept of universality.

In this chapter we'll define universality for quantum computing, and show how to prove that our quantum operations can be used as the basis for any quantum algorithm.
