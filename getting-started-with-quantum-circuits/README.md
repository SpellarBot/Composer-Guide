# Getting started with quantum circuits

To kickoff our guide to quantum circuits, we'll look at what it means to program at the circuit level. This will also explain a little about how our standard 'classical' computers work, so that we can start to understand how the quantum and classical differ.

As a first step towards this, we'll look at an example of quantum computing in action, and show that the variables we use in quantum programs are fundamentally different from their classical counterparts.

This chapter is intended for the broadest possible audience. You won't see any math that you didn't learn before you were 10. After reading this chapter, you should already be able to start thinking about interesting circuits to try out.
