# Getting started with quantum circuits

This guide will help you understand what it means to program quantum computers. It will guide you to a point where you can do interesting and useful things with IBM's composer, a simple graphical interface for creating quantum programs.

We'll start off slowly with a couple of informal articles. These cover the main ideas behind what it means to program a quantum computer, and give you a taste of why they are different from normal computers.

These articles should already give you some ideas for what to do on the composer. But for those who want to know more, we have a lot more we can tell you about. This content will be most useful for those who know a little about vectors and matrices, but it should also benefit those who don't.

You can start by reading an introduction to using the composer here. This will give you a guided tour of what buttons to press, and where to find everything.
